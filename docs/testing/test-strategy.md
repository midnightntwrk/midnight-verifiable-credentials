# Midnight Credentials Test Strategy

Version: `0.2-draft`

Status: Draft — companion to `../spec/midnight-credentials.md`

## Purpose

This document defines the test strategy for the Midnight Verifiable Credentials system. It covers:

1. The configuration dimensions that produce the full combinatorial space
2. The credential families and their claim structures
3. The shared ISO registry for interoperable field values
4. Concrete use cases that exercise meaningful subsets of the combination space
5. The test matrix mapping every combination to a test scenario
6. The test pyramid: which layer owns which tests

## Architecture Recap

The Midnight Credentials system has five layers:

| Layer | Package(s) | What it owns |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 0 | `credentials-iso-registry` | Shared ISO code types (country, currency, language, region) |
| 1 | `credentials`, `credentials-same-holder` | Generic VC/VP envelope, proof, holder-binding profiles, protocol |
| 2 | `credentials-{family}`, `credentials-{family}-secret` | Concrete credential families (claims, disclosures, predicates, validation) |
| 3 | `credentials-demo-contract`, business contracts | Business logic, capabilities, state mutation |
| 4 | `credentials-protocol`, `standalone-environment` | Protocol simulation, party agents, integration infrastructure |

Current-repository note:

- the fully validated workspace spine in this repository is currently centered
  on `credentials`, `credentials-birth`, `credentials-birth-secret`,
  `credentials-same-holder`, `credentials-iso-registry`,
  `credentials-offchain-did`, `credentials-openid`,
  `credentials-status-registry`, `credentials-protocol`,
  `credentials-demo-contract`, and `standalone-environment`
- additional families listed later in this strategy document describe the wider
  design space or adjacent prototype work, not current workspace packages on
  `develop`

Current validated CI shape:

- code-changing PRs run the full CI matrix
- docs-only PRs now use the workflow-level `Docs-only Validation` fast path
- boundary hygiene runs inside `ci:lint` through `check:package-boundaries`
- the current revocation/status slice also has a focused `ci:revocation` lane
- living-documentation scenarios now have a separate TypeScript BDD lane shape
  under `vc-bdd-scenarios/`; this is not a docs-only change class and should be
  treated as code
- CI change classes are mutually exclusive:
  - `docs_only` for markdown/docs-only diffs
  - `bdd_only` for the focused Serenity/JS scenario surface
  - full CI for everything else

## Configuration Dimensions

Every credential interaction is a point in a multi-dimensional configuration space.

### Dimension 1: Credential Family

| Family | Package | Claims | ISO Codes Used |
|--------|---------|--------|----------------|
| Birth | `credentials-birth` | subjectId, legalName, birthDate, birthCountry | country (3166-1) |
| Passport | `credentials-passport` | documentNumber, issuingCountry, nationality, givenName, familyName, birthDate, gender, expiryDate | country (3166-1), gender (ISO 5218) |
| Driving License | `credentials-driving-license` | licenseNumber, issuingCountry, issuingRegion, holderName, birthDate, licenseCategory, validFrom, validUntil | country (3166-1), region (3166-2) |
| National ID | `credentials-national-id` | documentNumber, issuingCountry, givenName, familyName, birthDate, birthPlace, residenceRegion, taxIdentifier | country (3166-1), region (3166-2) |
| AML/KYC Compliance | `credentials-compliance` | subjectId, amlStatus, sanctionsScreening, pepStatus, riskScore, jurisdiction, checkedAt, validUntilDay | country (3166-1) |
| Employee | `credentials-employee` | employeeId, organizationName, organizationId, department, role, clearanceLevel, employedSince | — |

Current workspace note for this dimension:

- `credentials-birth` is the current explicit-holder family on `develop`
- `credentials-birth-secret` is the current hidden-holder family on `develop`
- the remaining families in this table are design-space or adjacent-prototype
  examples, not validated local workspace packages

### Dimension 2: Holder Binding Profile

| Profile | Type | Privacy Level | Same-Holder Support |
|---------|------|---------------|---------------------|
| Explicit DID | `ExplicitHolderBinding` | Low — holder DID visible | No (trivial via DID match) |
| Blinded Secret | `BlindedSecretHolderBinding` | High — holder identity hidden | Yes (via shared secret witness) |

Note: `SecretHolderBinding` (non-blinded) exists in the generic layer but is not instantiated by any current credential family. It could serve as an intermediate profile if needed.

### Dimension 3: Selective Disclosure

Each credential family defines its own disclosure struct with per-field reveal flags.

| Disclosure Level | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------|
| None (predicate-only) | No raw claim values revealed — only predicate outcomes |
| Minimal (1 field) | Single field disclosed for structural matching |
| Selective (2-3 fields) | Multiple fields disclosed per verifier request |
| Full | All fields disclosed (not typical in privacy flows) |

### Dimension 4: Predicates

| Predicate Type | Applies To | Circuit Logic |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| Age >= threshold | birthDate claim | `currentDay - birthDateDays >= thresholdYears * 365` |
| Not expired | expiryDate / validUntil | `currentDay <= expiryDate` |
| Risk score <= threshold | riskScore claim | `riskScore <= threshold` |
| Freshness <= N days | checkedAt claim | `currentDay - checkedAt <= maxDays` |
| Category match | licenseCategory | `licenseCategory == requiredCategory` |
| Clearance >= level | clearanceLevel | `clearanceLevel >= requiredLevel` |
| Region match | residenceRegion | `residenceRegion.country == requiredCountry` |

### Dimension 5: Verifier-Scoped Pseudonym

| Option | When |
|--------|------|
| No pseudonym | Explicit holder, or privacy-maximal (no linkability at all) |
| Verifier-scoped | Secret holder — verifier needs pairwise local continuity |

### Dimension 6: Same-Holder Composition

| Composition | Credentials | Binding Requirement |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| Single | 1 | Any profile |
| Two-credential | 2 from different issuers | Blinded secret (shared holder secret) |
| Three-credential | 3 from different issuers | Blinded secret (extends same-holder pattern) |

### Dimension 7: Verifier Mode

| Mode | Implementation | State |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Off-chain agent | `VerifierAgent` | Stateless — evaluates and returns result |
| On-chain contract | `ContractVerifier` / business contract | Stateful — records, issues capabilities |

### Dimension 8: Capability Lifecycle

| Phase | Applies to |
|-------|-----------|
| No capability | Off-chain verifier, or verification-only contract |
| Issue capability | Contract verifier mints access artifact |
| Claim capability | Holder redeems capability |
| Deny re-claim | Second claim rejected (consumed) |

### Dimension 9: Protocol Envelope

| Level | What it covers |
|-------|---------------|
| Direct circuit | Pure circuit assertions without protocol message wrapping |
| Protocol messages | Full issuance (offer → request → result) and presentation (request → submission → result) with threaded envelopes |

### Dimension 10: Protocol Outcome Semantics

| Outcome model | What it means |
|---------------|---------------|
| Success result only | Happy-path protocol currently proves only successful completion messages |
| Local rejection outcome | Malformed or mismatched messages are rejected locally, for example by exceptions at the agent boundary |
| Explicit rejection result | The protocol defines a distinct rejection message or typed rejection outcome with stable failure semantics |

### Dimension 11: Credential Status Support

| Status level | What it means |
|--------------|---------------|
| Level 0 | No revocation/non-revocation support; claim expiry or session expiry only |
| Level 1 | Public status lookup with explicit freshness rules |
| Level 2 | Privacy-preserving non-revocation proof with explicit witness freshness rules |

Current repository packages now include prototype status capability surfaces,
but they do not yet claim full production-ready Level 2 support. See
[`../spec/credential-status.md`](../spec/credential-status.md).

Current implementation note:

- the repository now includes prototype status capability and authority
  attestation surfaces
- but it still does not claim final production-ready Level 2
  non-revocation support
- verifier/application-supplied root freshness remains an external policy
  decision in the current prototype
- current authority-attested coverage proves request binding, registry/root
  consistency, wrong-authority rejection, and expiration handling for the
  transitional Layer 3 status path

Current validated repository surfaces for this strategy:

- Layer 1: `credentials`, `credentials-same-holder`, `credentials-iso-registry`,
  `credentials-status-registry`
- Layer 2: `credentials-birth`, `credentials-birth-secret`
- Layer 2.5: `credentials-offchain-did`
- Layer 3: `credentials-demo-contract`
- Layer 4: `credentials-openid`, `credentials-protocol`, `standalone-environment`

When later sections discuss Passport, Compliance, Driving License, National ID,
or Employee families, read them as design-space matrix entries unless the repo
actually restores those packages on `develop`.

Current repository stance:

- the reference protocol layer now proves explicit rejection results for
  blinded-secret issuance, including malformed requests, offer/request
  mismatches, unknown offer references, expired offers, and expired requests
- the same reference protocol layer now proves explicit rejection results for
  blinded-secret presentation, including malformed submissions,
  request/submission mismatches, unsatisfied verifier requests, expired
  requests, and expired submissions
- the same reference protocol layer now proves idempotent re-delivery for
  duplicate blinded-secret presentation submissions and duplicate presentation
  outcomes
- the same reference layer now proves idempotent re-delivery for duplicate
  blinded-secret issuance requests and duplicate blinded-secret issuance
  outcomes
- the reference transport-shaped API now uses one normalized default time rule:
  omitted `currentDay` means `0n`
- holder-side tests still prove local rejection behavior for uncorrelated
  blinded-secret issuance outcomes
- holder-side tests now also prove local rejection behavior for uncorrelated
  blinded-secret presentation outcomes
- the repository now carries explicit message-level offer/request expiry fields
  in the blinded-secret issuance reference flow
- the repository now carries envelope-level request/submission expiry
  semantics in the blinded-secret presentation reference flow
- protocol-facing randomness is now injectable in the reference agent layer,
  but the default implementation remains deterministic for test/reference use
- the repository does not yet define a final interoperable rejection result
  contract across transport adapters

## Serenity/JS BDD Layer

The repository now also carries a TypeScript BDD layer under
`vc-bdd-scenarios/`.

Purpose:

- express a small number of curated use-case scenarios with Cucumber
- use Serenity/JS screenplay abstractions for readable tasks and questions
- generate report artifacts that engineers and integrators can read as living
  documentation

Boundary:

- this layer does not replace Vitest
- this layer should stay small and scenario-oriented
- this layer should reuse existing package exports and simulators rather than
  reimplement business logic
- Playwright belongs only in scenarios that exercise a real browser-facing flow;
  it is not required for the first library-first scenario slice

## Shared ISO Registry

### Package: `credentials-iso-registry`

Compact types for ISO-standard codes, stored as numeric `Uint<16>` values.

```compact
// ISO 3166-1 numeric country codes
export struct CountryCode {
  value: Uint<16>     // e.g., 276 = DE, 840 = US, 380 = IT, 826 = GB
}

// ISO 4217 numeric currency codes
export struct CurrencyCode {
  value: Uint<16>     // e.g., 978 = EUR, 840 = USD, 826 = GBP
}

// ISO 639 language codes (custom numeric mapping)
export struct LanguageCode {
  value: Uint<16>     // e.g., 1 = en, 2 = de, 3 = fr, 4 = es
}

// ISO 3166-2 region (country + subdivision)
export struct RegionCode {
  country: Uint<16>   // ISO 3166-1 numeric
  subdivision: Uint<16> // subdivision index within country
}

// ISO 5218 gender codes
export struct GenderCode {
  value: Uint<8>      // 0 = not known, 1 = male, 2 = female, 9 = not applicable
}
```

Design principles:
- Numeric values are preferred — they are circuit-friendly and comparison-safe
- UI renders numeric codes to human-readable text at the presentation layer
- Compact circuits can assert equality, inequality, and range checks on numeric codes
- All credential families import from this shared registry

| Test ID | Profile | Credentials | What it proves |
|---------|---------|------------|----------------|
| INT-EXP-01 | Explicit | Birth | Full stack with real DID resolution |

## Coverage by Dimension

### Holder Binding × Credential Family

| | Explicit DID | Blinded Secret |
|---|---|---|
| Birth | L2-BIRTH-* (done, 13 tests) | L2-BIRTHS-* (done, 11 tests) |
| Passport | L2-PASS-* (done, 14 tests) | L2-PASSS-* (done, 11 tests) |
| Driving License | L2-DL-* | L2-DLS-* |
| National ID | L2-NID-* | L2-NIDS-* |
| AML/KYC | L2-COMP-* | L2-COMPS-* |
| Employee | L2-EMP-* | L2-EMPS-* |

**12 family × profile combinations**, each with ~16 tests = **~192 Layer 2 tests**

### Disclosure Level × Credential Family

| | 0 (predicate-only) | 1 (minimal) | 2-3 (selective) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Birth | UC-1 | — | UC-2 |
| Passport | UC-1 | — | UC-2, UC-7 |
| Driving License | — | — | UC-4, UC-7 |
| National ID | — | — | UC-5 |
| AML/KYC | — | — | UC-2, UC-7, UC-8 |
| Employee | — | UC-6 | UC-3 |

### Predicate Type Coverage

| Predicate | Families that use it | Use Cases |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| age >= N | Birth, Passport, DL, NID | UC-1, UC-2, UC-4, UC-7 |
| not expired | Passport, DL, AML | UC-4, UC-7, UC-8 |
| risk score <= N | AML | UC-2, UC-8 |
| freshness <= N days | AML | UC-8 |
| category match | DL | UC-4 |
| clearance >= N | Employee | UC-3 |
| region match | NID | UC-5 |

### Same-Holder Composition Coverage

| Composition | Use Case | Credential Families |
|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| Single | UC-1, UC-3, UC-4, UC-5, UC-6, UC-8 | Various |
| Two-credential | UC-2 | Passport + AML/KYC |
| Three-credential | UC-7 | Passport + AML/KYC + Driving License |

### Verifier Mode Coverage

| Mode | Use Cases |
|------|-----------|
| Off-chain agent | UC-3, UC-8 |
| On-chain contract | UC-1, UC-2, UC-4, UC-5, UC-6, UC-7 |

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Foundation (current — done)

- [x] Generic core (Layer 1) — 9 tests
- [x] Birth credential family, both profiles (Layer 2) — 24 tests
- [x] Demo contract (Layer 3) — 7 tests
- [x] Protocol agents (Layer 4) — 21 tests
- [x] Birth standalone integration tests — 3 tests

### Phase 2: ISO Registry + Credential Families

- [x] `credentials-iso-registry` package with country, region, currency, language, gender codes — 5 tests
- [x] Passport credential family (explicit + secret variants) — 25 tests
- [x] Passport standalone smoke tests (explicit + secret profiles with real Midnight DIDs) — 2 tests
- [ ] Driving License credential family (explicit + secret variants)
- [ ] National ID credential family (explicit + secret variants)
- [ ] AML/KYC Compliance credential family (explicit + secret variants)
- [ ] Employee credential family (explicit + secret variants)

### Phase 3: Use Case Contracts

- [ ] UC-1: Age-gated venue contract (passport OR national ID)
- [ ] UC-2: DeFi onboarding contract (passport + AML same-holder)
- [ ] UC-3: Corporate access verifier (employee, off-chain)
- [ ] UC-4: Car rental contract (driving license)
- [ ] UC-5: Government benefit contract (national ID)
- [ ] UC-6: Whistleblower contract (employee, max privacy)
- [ ] UC-7: Travel check-in contract (3-credential staged)
- [ ] UC-8: Compliance relay verifier (AML, off-chain)

### Phase 4: Full Matrix Integration

- [ ] Protocol agent tests for all new families
- [ ] Integration tests for UC-2 and UC-7 (multi-credential with real DIDs)
- [x] Three-credential same-holder circuit (extends current two-credential pattern)

## Appendix: Negative Test Cases

Every positive test has a negative counterpart. Key negative cases:

| Category | Negative Test |
|----------|--------------|
| Wrong issuer | Credential signed by unauthorized issuer → rejected |
| Wrong holder | Presentation from different holder → rejected |
| Expired credential | Verifier checks expiry → rejected |
| Below age threshold | Age predicate fails → rejected |
| Missing disclosure | Request requires field, presentation hides it → rejected |
| Wrong pseudonym domain | Pseudonym from different domain → rejected |
| Different holder secret | Same-holder proof with two different secrets → rejected |
| Replayed presentation | Same challenge reused → rejected (if verifier tracks) |
| Tampered claim root | Modified claim after issuance → rejected |
| Wrong credential family | Passport presented where license required → rejected |
| Expired AML check | Freshness predicate fails → rejected |
| Risk score too high | Threshold predicate fails → rejected |
| Wrong license category | Category match fails → rejected |
| Insufficient clearance | Clearance predicate fails → rejected |
| Wrong region | Region match fails → rejected |
